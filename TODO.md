# TODO

1. Correct behavior when DEFAULT_SOFT_LIMIT_ENABLE is set to true
2. Move COOL-FLOOD away from PC13 so as to leave PC13 to the on-board LED. This is useful for trouble-shooting or sanity check with a "blink" firmware 
3. Consider replicating the serial interface on the USB port of the Blue Pill
