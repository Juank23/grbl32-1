# TODO

1. Correct the stepping pulse width
2. Correct behavior when DEFAULT_SOFT_LIMIT_ENABLE is set to true
3. Move the info in README.md to wiki pages 
4. Move COOLANT-FLOOD away from PC13 so as to leave PC13 solely for the on-board LED. This is useful for trouble-shooting or for a sanity check with a "blink" firmware 
5. Consider replicating the serial interface on the USB port of the Blue Pill
