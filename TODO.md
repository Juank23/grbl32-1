# TODO

1. Correct behavior when DEFAULT_SOFT_LIMIT_ENABLE is set to true
2. Move the info in README.md to wiki pages 
3. Move COOLANT-FLOOD away from PC13 so as to leave PC13 solely for the on-board LED. This is useful for trouble-shooting or for a sanity check with a "blink" firmware 
4. Consider replicating the serial interface on the USB port of the Blue Pill
